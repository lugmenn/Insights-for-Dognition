# Insights-for-Dognition

Dognition provides a way for dogs to be better understood by their owners. This is achieved thanks to a series of tests to evaluate a variety of skills and behavioural traits, in which the results are then used to classify their personality into different categories, and revealing their strenghts and in what aspects the might excel at.

As a data analyst whose job was to generate insights to find out how could the company retain their users and increase the number of customers using the platform, a database provided by Dognition was examined with the use of MySQL. It contained information about the resgistered users, their registered dogs, their exam answers and completed tests logs, as well as customer reviews about the testing program and activity throughout the website. Sensitive personal data from the users (such as names, e-mails, phone numbers and full address) was not included in the dataset for analysis.
